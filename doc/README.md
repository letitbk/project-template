Keep the current version of the paper in the `current` folder. 
When you submit, archive the version by creating a folder with a timestamped folder, e.g. `20200202_nature`. 

Start writing early. 
Actually, start the project with writing down the key idea and a few key references. 
As the project progresses, populate the method section as you plan & execute experiments. 
Once you have some results, focus on figures, each with caption, methods, and results -- the "mini-papers". 
Use `supp.tex` to stash whatever that may not be worth being in the main manuscript.
