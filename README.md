# Project template

A simple template for a research project. 

```
├── 0-posted
├── admin
├── code
├── data
├── doc
├── output
├── stash
```

What each folder should include:

* `admin` : any administrative stuffs such as a copy of email exchange, data use agreement, IRB documents, and so on.
* `code` : any computer codes (R, python, Stata, …) you used for this project. When you have a separate GitHub repository for your project, you may want to use this place for your own backup that you can use to share with others who are not using Github.
* `data` : Don't use Github to share data.
* `doc` : any document (tex, powerpoint slide, docx, ...) that you write.
  + I think that it is good to separate out what you write from what you read
  + potentially you can create `literature` or `reading` folder separately to share these, but I think that it is better to share them through Zotero or other mechanisms (e.g., use hyper-links in Google Doc)
* `output` : your output, including figure files or table files. 
* `stash` : any other stuffs that you don't know where you can put them. 

## some notes
It is the directory structure that I found useful for my research workflow, but you may want to develop your own directory structure. Once you make your own directory structure, try to consistently use it for your future project (don’t change the directory structure of your past project), and update it as you use it (remember that there’s no perfect directory structure).
