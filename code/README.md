Some general principles. 

1. your codes should clearly indicate what `input` data you used, and what will be the `output` in their headings. 
2. Create a sub-folder if you think that each code would be too longer. 
3. Use number to indicate the order of your codes (`1_read_data.R`, `2_clean_variables.R`). 

Here's what you do.
* `exp` : Always create a time-stamped folder under `exp` before you write your code, and then create any code to run some experiments. No one is going to review this code.
* `workflow` : Once you complete your small experiment, copy and paste your code to the `workflow` folder. Carefully document what you do under this folder since all these codes should be able to be reviewed by you (in the future) or others.
* `package` : when you create package or some functions that you will use across the whole project, here's the place you want to include them.
