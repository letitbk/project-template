Put your experiments. Create a timestamped folder for each experiment (e.g., `20200101_first_data_exploration` or `20201212_model_visualization`) because it makes it much easier to locate your experiments later. 

Use literate and interactive tools such as Jupyter notebook (lab). 
Don't overcomplicate. 
If the project is simple, a series of notebooks may be all you need. 
However, if the project involves complex data manipulation and lots of complex computation steps, keep each experiment small and focused; incorporate what you experimented into the library and workflow so that the whole pipeline can be tested, automated, and modularized.
