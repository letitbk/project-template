Put your experiments. Create a timestamped folder for each experiment (e.g., `2020-01-01_first_data_exploration` or `2020-12-12_model_visualization`) because it makes it much easier to locate your experiments later. 

If the project is simple, a series of R codes may be all you need. 
However, if the project involves complex data manipulation and lots of complex computation steps, keep each experiment small and focused; incorporate what you experimented into the library and workflow so that the whole pipeline can be tested, automated, and modularized.
