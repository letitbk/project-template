This is where you'll "post" your analysis, results, and paper, all of which will be time-stamped. Create folder name with time and content.
* example : `2022-02-01_ASA_annualmeeting`

You should post from time to time especially when you submit your paper to academic conferences, and journals, because you should be able to reproduce and replicate your analysis for each different versions of your paper.
